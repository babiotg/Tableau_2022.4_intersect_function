# Tableau_2022.4_intersect_function

This is a short project for the sole purpose of demonstrating how to use the new geospatial intersection feature in Tableau 2022.4.  
The Interactive Visualization can be displayed at the link [Health State of New York Trees](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/barbara.callegari/viz/HealthStateofNewYorkTrees) on my Tableau profile.


## Scope of the project
